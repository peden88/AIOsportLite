/**
 * TeamLogoService.js
 *
 * Resolves the two sides of a fixture title to ESPN team logo URLs, so catalog
 * cards can show real artwork instead of a generated placeholder.
 *
 * Backed by a bundled table (data/espn-teams.json) generated from ESPN's public
 * team endpoints by scripts/build-espn-teams.js. It is a static file on purpose:
 * ESPN's site.api host 403s from some egress IPs, and a boot-time fetch would
 * make catalog artwork depend on that. Regenerate it when schools/teams change.
 *
 * Matching is deliberately conservative. A wrong logo is worse than no logo —
 * a card that confidently shows Oklahoma State for a Northwestern Oklahoma State
 * game is more misleading than one that shows the team names as text. Every rule
 * below exists to make a near-miss decline instead of guess:
 *
 *   1. exact normalized match      "los angeles rams"
 *   2. exact de-spaced match       "ottawaredblacks" -> ESPN's "Ottawa Red Blacks"
 *   3. whole-word run, >=2 words, covering >=75% of the side's words
 *
 * Bare single-word nicknames ("bombers", "argonauts", "tigers") are never used
 * as a fallback key: they collide across leagues and divisions.

A self-hosted addon for [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) and [Nuvio](https://nuvio.tv) that gathers live sports fixtures and 24/7 channels from several public sources into one catalog.

- **One tile per event.** When several sources carry the same fixture or channel, their streams are merged onto a single tile.
- **Covers for everything.** Fixtures are drawn from both teams' crests, and channels get a cover with their logo. The server renders them, so every player shows the same thing.
- **A tidy Channels tab.** It's sorted A to Z, and channels with nothing playing are hidden until they come back.
- **Your settings, one install link.** Save sports, sources, teams and timezone as a profile, and the install link stays the same when you change them.

This is a fork of [rajhodedara/live-sport-plugin](https://github.com/rajhodedara/live-sport-plugin). Credit for the original project goes there.

> **Streams come from third-party websites.** AIOSports hosts no video. Sources change and go offline often, so a fixture with no working stream is normal and usually not a problem with your setup.

## Quick start with Docker

You need Docker with Compose v2.24 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlp2069/aiosports.git
cd aiosports
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build takes a few minutes. Then open `http://<your computer's IP address>:7000/configure` in a browser on the same network. On Windows, `ipconfig` shows the address; on macOS or Linux, use `ipconfig getifaddr en0` or `ip a`.

The server only needs to reach the internet, not be reachable from it. Anything that can open the address can use the addon, though, so read [Passwords, profiles and the dashboard](#passwords-profiles-and-the-dashboard) before you expose it.

## Install it in Stremio or Nuvio

1. Open `/configure` on your server and pick your sports, sources and teams.
2. Press **Save** to get an install link that ends in `/manifest.json`. You can also copy the link from the install button.
3. Add that link in your player:
   - **Stremio:** paste it into the search box on the Addons page, then press Install.
   - **Nuvio:** go to Settings → Addons and add the link.

### Stremio needs https

Stremio only loads addons over `https://`. The one exception is an addon at `http://127.0.0.1` on the same computer. A home address like `http://192.168.1.50:7000` works in Nuvio but not in Stremio. Two common ways to get https:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel.** Install [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/), then run `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:7000`. That gives you a temporary `https://….trycloudflare.com` address. A named tunnel on your own domain gives you a permanent one.
- **A reverse proxy with a certificate**, such as Caddy, nginx or Traefik, on a domain you control.

Once you have an https address, put it in `.env` as `ADDON_URL=https://your.address` and run `docker compose up -d` again. Reinstall the addon from the https address.

## Updating

```bash
cd aiosports
git pull
docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

`--build` matters: without it, Compose keeps running the old image. Saved profiles live in the `aiosports-data` volume and survive updates. `--remove-orphans` clears out the container from older versions, which used a different service name.

If the manifest id or the tabs changed in a release, the release notes say so. In that case, reinstall the addon in your player.

## Other ways to run it

### Prebuilt image

Every push to `main` publishes `ghcr.io/peden88/aiosportlite:latest` for **linux/amd64 and linux/arm64**. The command below is the same on either: Docker reads your machine's architecture and pulls the matching one. That covers an Oracle Cloud Ampere instance, a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, and an Apple Silicon Mac, as well as an ordinary x86 server.

```bash
docker run -d --name aiosports -p 7000:7000 \
  --env-file .env -e DATA_DIR=/data -v aiosports-data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped ghcr.io/peden88/aiosportlite:latest
```

### Oracle Cloud, and other ARM servers

An Ampere instance runs the command above unchanged -- there is no separate ARM tag to find, and nothing to build. Oracle's Always Free tier gives you four Ampere cores and 24 GB of memory, which is considerably more than this needs.

The one thing that catches people out is not the addon. **A port on an Oracle instance has to be opened in two places**, and opening it in one leaves it shut:

1. **The cloud side.** Add an ingress rule for TCP 7000 to the security list (or network security group) on your instance's subnet, in the console.
2. **The machine itself.** Oracle's own images arrive with host firewall rules that drop nearly everything, and the Ubuntu images do not use `ufw` -- editing it there does nothing. The rules live in `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`.

On that second one, mind where the rule goes: there is a `REJECT` line near the end, and anything added below it never matches. Copy the line that allows SSH, change the port on the copy, and leave the SSH line exactly where it is -- getting that wrong locks you out of the instance.

If you would rather not expose a port at all, put the instance behind a Cloudflare Tunnel as described under [https](#stremio-needs-https). Nothing then listens publicly, and you get the https address Stremio needs in the same move.

### Node.js

Node.js 22 or newer is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlp2069/aiosports.git
cd aiosports
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` builds before it starts, so a separate build step isn't needed. To keep it running in the background with PM2, start it from the `aiosports` folder, because the internal resolver is found relative to that folder:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name aiosports -- start
pm2 save
```

## Settings

Settings live in `.env`. Copy `.env.example` and edit it, and restart after a change. These are the ones most people set:

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ADDON_URL` | Your public address, e.g. `https://sports.example.com`. Needed for Stremio (see [https](#stremio-needs-https)). |
| `AUTH_KEY` | Password for the catalog and `/configure` pages. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | Password for `/dashboard`. The dashboard stays closed until this is set. |
| `TZ` | Timezone for kickoff times, for viewers who haven't picked one. |
| `HIDE_EMPTY_CHANNELS` | `0` lists every channel, even ones with no streams right now. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Only for a reverse proxy on a public address. See `.env.example`. |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | `off` disables the per-address request limits. |
| `LIVE_BUFFER_SECONDS` | Seconds of extra buffer for every viewer who hasn't chosen their own. `0`, the default, plays as close to live as the source allows. |

`.env.example` explains the rest, including `DATA_DIR`, `LINK_SECRET` and the source-specific options.

## Passwords, profiles and the dashboard

| | Without it | With it |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_KEY` | Anyone who can open the address can browse the catalog and `/configure`. | Visitors sign in at `/login` first. |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | `/dashboard` is closed to everyone. | Open `/dashboard` and sign in with the token. |

**Use long random values**, for example the output of `openssl rand -base64 24`. After eight wrong guesses from one address, sign-in pauses for five minutes.

**Saved profiles.** Every profile has its own install link, so two people can keep different settings on one server.

- With `AUTH_KEY` set, anyone who has signed in can see and change every profile.
- Without it, a profile can only be changed from the browser that saved it. To change it from another device, use that profile's **edit link**, shown under the install link on `/configure`. Keep the edit link private.

**What stays open.** The manifest, catalogs, streams and artwork are never behind a password, because Stremio and Nuvio have no way to sign in. Someone who has your install link can therefore use the addon. To keep the addon itself private, put an IP allowlist or a VPN in front of it.

**Behind a reverse proxy.** Caddy, nginx and Traefik on the same machine or network work without extra setup. If your proxy sits on a public address, set `TRUST_PROXY` as `.env.example` describes, and never set it to `true`.

## Catalog tabs

| Tab | Holds |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Live Now | Fixtures in progress. Channels are not mixed in. |
| ⚽ Football | Association football |
| 🏉 Rugby | NRL, Premiership, URC, Top 14, Super Rugby and test rugby |
| 🏎️ Racing | Motorsport |
| 📺 Channels | Every 24/7 channel, A to Z, with a genre filter |
| 🥊 MMA | MMA, boxing and combat-sport events |
| ⏱️ Upcoming · ⭐ Your Teams | Everything ahead, and the teams you follow in `/configure` (including games nobody streams yet -- see below) |
| 📍 Local | The channels of the cities you name in `/configure` (see below) |

In `/configure` you can hide, rename and reorder the tabs.

### What a fixture tile knows

Fixtures are matched against ESPN's scoreboards, which is where the visiting side, the league badge and a kickoff you can trust come from. Two things follow from that:

- **the network carrying the game** is named on the tile -- `📡 On FOX`. It is a line of information, not something to open: what a network station streams free is its news channel, never the broadcast (see below);
- **the kickoff shown is ESPN's** wherever a source site disagrees with it by more than a quarter of an hour. Source sites type the wrong hour often enough to be worth overruling, usually by reading a time zone wrong.

A fixture ESPN has not listed keeps whatever its source said, and nothing on the tile changes.

⭐ Your Teams goes one step further: it lists your teams' fixtures for the week ahead **even when no site has posted a stream yet**, marked `⏳ No streams listed yet`. Links usually appear within an hour or so of kickoff, and until then the tab used to be empty exactly when you were planning your week.

### Local channels

The ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX tiles carry streams from local stations all over the country, each labelled with its city and call sign. Name your own cities under **Local Channels** in `/configure` -- `Chicago, Knoxville TN, Phoenix` -- and:

- each of those cities' stations that iptv-org has a stream for becomes a tile of its own ("FOX 32 Chicago News", "ABC 15 Phoenix News"), in the Channels tab under the Local genre and in the 📍 Local tab, together with channels whose names say the city (CBS News Chicago, Chicago Sports Network);
- your cities' stations are listed first on the network tiles.

What a network station streams free is its 24/7 **news** channel (FOX LOCAL, NBC Chicago News), not its broadcast signal: nobody may stream that, so the network's schedule and the games are never on these tiles. A game is on its own tile in its sport's tab, where the FOX or CBS stream is that game's broadcast. A city shared by several states goes to the one with the TV market; add the state to say otherwise. Only stations somebody has contributed a stream for can be listed, so a small market may have none. `LOCAL_MARKETS` in `.env` adds cities whose stations are listed as tiles for everyone on the server; the 📍 Local tab and the first-place ordering follow each profile's own cities.

## Sources

StreamFree, TimStreams, Streamed.pk, SportyHunter, WatchFooty, CDNLive, StreamSports99, Streamic, TotalSportek, USA TV and iptv-org. Turn each one on or off in `/configure`, and drag them into the order you prefer.

**Sort Streams By** decides what that order is worth. *Rating* ranks every stream on what was measured about it — the resolution and bitrate read from the stream itself, and whether that source has been answering lately. *Source order* hands you your own order instead, best stream first within each source. Dragging the sources selects the second on its own; either can be chosen outright.

## FAQ and troubleshooting

**A fixture has no streams.** The source sites haven't posted one yet, or took it down. Streams often appear shortly before kickoff. Try again closer to the start, or pick another source's tile. A tile in ⭐ Your Teams marked `⏳ No streams listed yet` is this, said in advance: the game is on ESPN's schedule and no site has posted a link to it.

**Two streams buffer at the same moment.** They are probably the same machine reached two ways. The list puts the best stream from each server at the top for that reason, so the second row down is a genuinely different server rather than a second link to the first one.

**Stremio won't install the addon.** It needs an https address; see [Stremio needs https](#stremio-needs-https).

**Covers show only a name for a moment.** The first time a tab opens, the server fetches logos and draws covers. They're cached afterwards -- on the data volume too, so a restart does not draw them again; only an update that changes how cards look draws them once more -- and the server warms them in the background after it starts.

**The server is busy for a few minutes after an update.** Only when the data volume is missing: without it, every restart re-reads every source, refetches every logo and redraws every cover. With `DATA_DIR` on a volume, the catalog, the cards, the logos and the channel checks are all kept, and a restart serves them at once.

**A channel disappeared.** Channels with no streams across two checks at least 15 minutes apart are hidden, and they come back once they play again. `HIDE_EMPTY_CHANNELS=0` shows them all.

**Streamed's streams buffer in Nuvio but play in a browser.** Streamed's CDN only answers clients that look like a browser, so the server fetches its video chunks for the player and relays them. Any host that behaves that way is found out by trying one chunk and relayed from then on; every other host's chunks go straight to the player. Relaying costs the server the stream's bandwidth, a few hundred kilobytes every few seconds per viewer (`PROXY_SEGMENT_HOSTS` in `.env.example`).

**A stream microbuffers -- it never really breaks, but it keeps catching itself.** Usually the source, not the connection. Sources here publish a four-segment playlist and some of them publish in bursts: measured on two of three, eight seconds of nothing and then two segments at once. A player starts three segments from the end of a playlist, which is about twelve seconds of video, so an eight-second pause spends most of the cushion and anything else on top of it stalls. Set **Extra Buffer** in `/configure` (or `LIVE_BUFFER_SECONDS` for everyone) and the server hands the player a deeper window of what the source has already published, and tells it to start further back in it. You see the game that much later, and the bursts stop mattering. Sources that delete a segment the moment they stop listing it are found out and left alone.

**My saved settings were lost after an update.** Profiles are stored in `DATA_DIR`. Compose keeps them on the `aiosports-data` volume. With `docker run`, add `-v aiosports-data:/data -e DATA_DIR=/data`.

**Port 7000 is already in use.** Change the left side of `"7000:7000"` in `docker-compose.yml`, for example to `"7100:7000"`.

**Can I host it on Render, Vercel or Railway?** It's not recommended. Free app hosts tend to suspend apps that scrape websites or relay media. A spare computer, a Raspberry Pi or a small VPS works better.

**Does it work on a Raspberry Pi?** Yes. The prebuilt image ships for arm64 as well as amd64, so `docker compose up -d` pulls the right one; building from source with the Quick start steps also works.
